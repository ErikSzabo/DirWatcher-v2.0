# DirWatcher v2.0

This will be the future of DirWatcher. Once I have done with this, I will delete the original (bad) one.

This project will use electron with web components. It will have much better data structures, and file handling.

Itt will be more scalable, and expandable thanks to web components and better program design.

An installer and auto update "feature" will be provided.
